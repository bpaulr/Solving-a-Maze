# Solving-a-Maze
Implementation of the A* path finding algorithm for a maze (with wrapping) problem.

Running Pre-Prepared Tests
----------------------------
To run pre-prepared tests simply compile all files in the project's src and run the MazeSolverTester file with no run time arguments.


Running Custom Input File(s)
----------------------------
To use a specific input file, again compile all files in the src folder and provide at least 2 run time arguments to either MazeSolverTester or MazeSolver. The format of the arguments is "<INPUT_FILE(S)_DIR> <INPUT_1.TXT> ... <INPUT_N.TXT>".
A input file directory must be provided and at least 1 input file must be provided. Providing more than 1 input file will run the algorithm on all provided input files.
